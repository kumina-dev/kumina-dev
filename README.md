**Software Developer (Personal Projects)**  
Building tools for sustainable studying, motivation, and long-term progress — with a strong focus on **security, privacy, and data ownership**.

I’m currently completing civil service and using this time to build real-world software projects.
My goal is to develop a strong technical foundation and prepare for future **Software Engineering (AMK)** studies, while actively working toward a **junior / trainee / summer role** in software development.

## 🧠 Current Focus

### AMK Survival Platform (Personal Project)
A habit tracker designed for demanding study environments, focused on **persistence over performance**.

The system is intentionally designed to avoid burnout patterns and unnecessary data exposure:
- Minimum effort days (showing up matters)
- Low-Power Mode for difficult weeks
- Soul Leveling (progress based on persistence, not grinding)
- Lightweight Identity Service with clear **user data ownership**
- Offline-first by default — data stays on the user’s device

This project is both a **personal tool I use daily** and a **portfolio project**.

---

## 🔐 Security & Privacy Mindset

I’m especially interested in building software that:
- minimizes data collection
- keeps user data local whenever possible
- avoids unnecessary accounts and tracking
- separates identity from application logic
- treats privacy as a **design decision**, not a feature toggle

Rather than adding complexity, I aim for **simple, auditable architectures** that are easier to reason about and secure by default.

---

## 🧩 Key Concepts I’m Exploring

- Designing systems that don’t punish failure
- State modeling for long-running personal data
- Identity abstraction and data ownership
- MVP-driven development with clear scope boundaries
- Offline-first applications and privacy-conscious UX

I’m interested in building software that respects **human limits** *and* **user trust**.
