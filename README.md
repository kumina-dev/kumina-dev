# Hey, I'm Ville 👋

I'm a software developer who enjoys building small tools that somehow grow into full projects.  
Most of my work lives around **web development**, **indie projects**, and **developer tooling**.

---

## 🧠 What I’m into

- ⚙️ **Full-stack development** – modern frontend + solid backend basics  
- 🧩 **Developer experience** – CLIs, utilities, monorepos, project templates  
- 🌐 **Web tech** – TypeScript, React, Node.js, and friends  
- 🧪 **Learning by building** – I like to test ideas by shipping something small and iterating

---

## 🔭 Current focus

- 🛠️ Working on personal/indie projects (like “MukulaSoft” and similar experiments)
- 📚 Improving my understanding of software architecture and maintainable codebases
- 🧹 Cleaning up old projects and turning them into reusable starter kits

---

## 🛠️ Tech I use

**Languages**

- TypeScript / JavaScript  
- HTML / CSS

**Tools & Frameworks**

- React  
- Node.js  
- Git & GitHub  
- Monorepo tooling (workspaces, etc.)

**Other stuff**

- VS Code  
- macOS & Windows  
- A lot of terminal

## 📂 Pinned projects

> Check out my pinned repositories below for the things I’m most happy with.  
> I try to keep readmes clear and code reasonably clean.

Some of the things you might find:

- 🎨 **UI experiments** – design systems, reusable components, theming  
- 🌐 **Web apps** – small utilities, dashboards, or playground apps  
- 🧰 **Utilities** – scripts and tools that make my own workflow less painful

---

## 🤝 Reach out

- 💬 Open an issue or discussion on any repo if you have questions or ideas  
- 🧪 I’m always up for experimenting with new project ideas, refactors, or collaborations

Thanks for stopping by 👋  
There’s probably some work-in-progress code somewhere below this line.
